# Mobius Development Intern Exercise

Here are the files for everything. The `Progress-Screenshots` detail screenshots I took during the exercise. I have a folder for both the PNGs and JPGs of the generated images. The last folder contains the videos of the cat playing with yarn. Install them and view on VLC, it might look weird or inaccurate on other media players.
